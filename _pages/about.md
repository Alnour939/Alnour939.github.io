Thank you for visiting my website. My name is Alnour Altoum, and I am a mathematician with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Erciyes University, Turkey. My research interests are enumerative combinatorics, number theory, and cryptography. During my PhD, I developed a strong foundation in this field, contributing new insights into classical Weyl groups and generalized symmetric groups. My work includes advancements in integer representations, inversion statistic, and the development of Lah, Mahonian, and Cauchy numbers of types B and D.
